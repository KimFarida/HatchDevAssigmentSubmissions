// Note:
/*
This implementation demonstrates:

1. Interfaces for Product and CartItem: These interfaces define the structure that concrete products and cart items should follow, ensuring consistency and allowing for polymorphism.
2. Composition for ShoppingCart: The ShoppingCart class is composed of a PaymentProcessor and a ShippingProcessor, demonstrating the "has-a" relationship. This allows for flexibility in swapping out different payment or shipping processors without modifying the ShoppingCart class itself.
3. SOLID Principles:
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class has a single responsibility. For example, the PaymentProcessor is responsible for processing payments, and the ShoppingCart is responsible for managing cart items and the checkout process.
-Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The design is open for extension but closed for modification. We can easily add new types of products or payment/shipping processors without altering existing classes.
-Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Concrete implementations of interfaces (ConcreteProduct, ConcreteCartItem, etc.) can be substituted for their base types (Product, CartItem, etc.) without affecting the correctness of the program.
-Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Interfaces are kept small and focused on specific responsibilities, such as PaymentProcessor and ShippingProcessor.
-Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules (e.g., ShoppingCart) depend on abstractions (e.g., PaymentProcessor, ShippingProcessor) rather than concrete implementations. This allows for decoupling and easier unit testing.
